- 👋 Hi, I’m @ChrisCross1983

- 👀 I’m interested in wildlife conservation and animal protection, software development, and creative tech projects. My passion lies in combining technology with environmental & social causes to make a meaningful impact.

- 🌱 I’m currently working on my 4th project, where I’ll showcase my full stack development skills, including what I’m learning now—Bootstrap. I love using technology to make projects lively and engaging. Check out my previous projects: Home of Wildlife Animals, Marvel Millionaire, and Workout Creator.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that bring together tech and conservation efforts, or anything that aims to improve people's lives through innovative solutions.

- 📫 How to reach me: Feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn or reach out through my GitHub profile.

- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him

- ⚡ Fun fact: I’m currently preparing for an exciting chapter of my life — moving to Tanzania in 2026 to dedicate myself fully to wildlife conservation. Together with my wife, we want to make a real difference for the animals there.
