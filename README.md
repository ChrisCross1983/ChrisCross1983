### About me

👋 Hi, I’m Chris,

👀 In my private time, I’m passionate about spending time with my family (Ramona and our two cats) as well as supporting wildlife conservation and animal protection. On a professional level, I am driven by my interest in software development and creative tech projects, alongside my strengths in customer interaction developed through years in sales. My ultimate goal is to combine these passions and skills into a meaningful contribution that unites technology with environmental and social causes.

🌱 I’m currently working on my 4th project, where I’ll showcase my full stack development skills, including what I’m learning now — Bootstrap. I love using technology to make projects lively and engaging. Check out my previous projects which are pinned below on my profile:

🐸 Frogs of Fury Hackathon Project (August 2024)

I participated in my first Hackathon with over 70 participants, where I teamed up with three other amazing developers to create Frogs of Fury, a retro-inspired action game. We won 1st place with our fun and challenging concept! 🎉 This game pays homage to classic arcade games like "Contra" and features an endless platformer challenge where players leap to higher levels, defeat enemies, and even team up in a co-op mode. I'm incredibly proud of what we achieved in such a short time!

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that bring together tech and conservation efforts, or anything that aims to improve people's lives through innovative solutions.

⚡ Fun fact: I’m currently preparing for an exciting chapter of my life — moving to Tanzania, a long-term goal, to dedicate ourselves fully to wildlife and animal conservation/protection. Together with my wife, we want to make a real difference for the animals there.

I’m excited to connect with like-minded individuals, recruiters, and companies interested in collaborating!

Stay awesome!

Chris
