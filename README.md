### About me

👋 Hi, I’m Chris,

👀 In my private time, I’m passionate about spending time with my family (Ramona and our two cats) as well as supporting wildlife conservation and animal protection. On a professional level, I am driven by my interest in software development and creative tech projects, alongside my strengths in customer interaction developed through years in sales. My ultimate goal is to combine these passions and skills into a meaningful contribution that unites technology with environmental and social causes.

🌱 I’m currently working on my fifth project as part of the Code Institute program, which marks the start of the “Advanced Frontend Development” specialization. This project focuses on building dynamic and interactive user interfaces using modern JavaScript technologies – primarily React. It's a great opportunity to deepen my full stack development skills, especially in creating responsive, user-friendly applications. You can explore my previous projects pinned below on my profile:

🐸 Frogs of Fury Hackathon Project (August 2024)

I participated in my first Hackathon with over 70 participants, where I teamed up with three other amazing developers to create Frogs of Fury, a retro-inspired action game. We won 1st place with our fun and challenging concept! 🎉 This game pays homage to classic arcade games like "Contra" and features an endless platformer challenge where players leap to higher levels, defeat enemies, and even team up in a co-op mode. I'm incredibly proud of what we achieved in such a short time!

Check out the game here [Frogs of Fury Live Site](https://erikas-ramanauskas.github.io/Frogs-of-Fury/) ([GitHub Repository](https://github.com/ChrisCross1983/team_9_august_2024_chris?tab=readme-ov-file))

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that bring together tech and conservation efforts, or anything that aims to improve people's lives through innovative solutions.

⚡ Fun fact: I met my wife in Berlin, and after just three days, we decided to move in together. Three months later, during the intermission of the musical "Tanz der Vampire," I proposed to her.

I’m excited to connect with like-minded individuals, recruiters, and companies interested in collaborating!

Stay awesome!

Chris
